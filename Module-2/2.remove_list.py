#2. How will you remove last object from a list? 
#Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?

"""-> The del operator deletes the element at the specified index location from the list.
-> To delete the last element of a list, you can use the negative index-1.
-> The use of the negative index allows us to delete the last element, even without calculating the length of the list."""
