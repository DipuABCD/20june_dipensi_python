#27. What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?

"""
->In many programming languages, including Python, the isinstance() is commonly used to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class.
->In the context of Python, you would use it as follows:-
                                 result = isinstance(o, A)
->The isinstance() function checks if the object (first argument)
->an instance or subclass of classinfo class (second argument). 
->Return Value : true if the object is an instance or subclass of a class,
->or any element of the tuple false otherwise.
