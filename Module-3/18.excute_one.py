#18. What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed.

"""
-> The expression "1" == 1 is executed, it involves a comparison between a string and a number in a programming context. 
-> The outcome of this comparison depends on the programming language being used.
-> False, It simply evaluates to False and does not raise any exception. 
-> because one is string and other is integer.
-> The statements in the finally block will always be executed, whether an exception is thrown or not.
